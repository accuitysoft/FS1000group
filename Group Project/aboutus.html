    <p>HI, I'm Shane! 
        
        As an Travel Tours specialist, I’ve been able to indulge my love of Europe, with trips through the wineries of France, ancient cities of Italy, to cruises along the Rhine to see the magnificent Ancient churches. Now I’m able to share my love of the region with people every day and make dream trips a reality.

    <p>HI, I’M Matt!

        Welcome to my little slice of the web. Here’s my story: after graduating with a BA/MA in Communication I decided the 9-to-5 wasn’t for me. I left office walls and two-week vacations behind in 2011 to pursue the world and a career in Travel Tours Leader

        <img src = "images1/Escalin.jpg" width="160" height="200">

    <p>HI, I’M Escalin!

        I love this job because I can support my family without needing to go abroad. I also love to see people from different parts of the world. Tourism is developing in South East Asia and this is good for the economy. We are always reducing the risk of negative impacts and the money is always going back to the local people.

    <p>HI, I'M Kinjal!
        
        I wake up at 6am and have a nice cup of coffee and a Sandwich, take my two dogs (a border collie and pug) for their morning walk and watch the weather on Good Morning Africa when I get back. After taking my two children to their school’s breakfast club for 7.30am, I’m in work for 8am.
